### Building a Compiler.

Should be a good learning exercise, and can be used to demonstrate my knowledge as well? Currently a basic expression evaluator.

1.  Built a compiler from scratch, using C#. Made use of theory learnt in
    Compiler Design, to build various components.
2.  Built the Lexer, then the Parser, then the Syntax Trees, which are
    passed onto the self-made Evaluator, various binders to add the
    semantics of the language.
3.  Provided Error handling and debugging tools for the developer to
    make use while building the structure, such as the Binary
    Expressions, the tree path, etc.
4.  It is a work in progress, will add more features, such as more
    operators, better code optimizations, etc.
